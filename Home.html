	Ever since I was little I knew that life was never going to be easy. Growing up I was never the kid who was apart of the crowd or even fit into his enviornment. From a very younge age I began to learn that everyone is differnt in life and those differences are something that we should hold near and dear to our hearts. If we start to expect to see ourselves in others then we should ask ourselves, "Is this healthy for me and my surroundings?" I graduated elementary school from Cesar E. Chavez MCC, High School from Benito Juarez Community Academy, and Culinary School from NECI (The New England Culinary Institute). I am a proud product of CCAP (The Careers Through Culinary Arts Program), and NECI. I am what I am today because of the teachings and training that I recieved while learning in these two institutions.
